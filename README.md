This website for example, was a challenge to create
something fresh on web BUT (all in caps) I'm only allowed
to use HTML. Additionaly I also can't use scrapped HTML
attributes for example bgcolor, etc.

So here is the deal. I'm going to use standard table also while
following six grid convention. YES this page is divided into
six table columns. If you are geeky or something try to
inspect this page and change table border argument from
zero to one and see the magic!

I was happy with the final results. If you too?
Find all my social handles :P and connect me everywhere :P

Just to have a cherry on the cake, I hosted this
portfolio website on github. Also ignore services and
testimonials page. I leave blank sheet for you to draw!
